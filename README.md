A collection of widgets for use in the ProseMirror Editor

In [ThinkSpace](http://www.thinkspace.org), 
faculty use CKEditor to build content in multiple pages called phases which are 
linked together forming a complex problem for students to solve. CKEditor is great but has typical HTML editor problems and takes work to add new widgets to insert. **Enter ProseMirror**.

The above ProseMirror editor displays a number of widgets which can be inserted into HTML.  Insert the desired widget and supply the attributes requested. Tab between fields and press Enter to insert the element. *If you don't supply an attribute nothing will be created.* For most widgets, click on the widget to change the attributes.

A brief description of the widgets are shown below:

* **Textfield, Textarea, Checkbox and Select** are used by faculty to prompt for questions in the process of solving a problem.
* **InlineMath and BlockMath** use MathJax to display equations. We need these for scientific and engineering problems.
* **Spreadsheet** widget displays an Excel-like experience for business and engineeroring.  Handsontable is used for integration. Spreadsheet also demonstrates how many well-formed javascript toolkits can be used to provide new capabilities.
* **IFrame** widget lets you embed websites, youTube, GoogleMaps...
* **MultipleChoice, CheckList and Scale** form the basis for a Test/Survey/Quiz/Exam document schema. Creating MultipleChoice and CheckList were cumbersome in CKEditor because each individual checkbox and radiobutton had to be inserted. It it now as easy as a bulletlist.  It is also easier to enter than GoogleForms and allows the insertion of media in answers which faculty need.

Finally, ThinkSpace supports **team-based learning**.  The ProseMirror <strong>collaboration</strong> capabilities are 
ideal for student teams to interact on documents.

This is exciting!
